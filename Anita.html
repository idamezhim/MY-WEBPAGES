    <p>California’s Coronavirus Strategy</p>

    <b>The state is flattening the curve. What comes next?</b>

    <hr />

    <div class="container">

      <p class="rules">
        Ever since reports emerged last week that California has successfully
        bent the curve, people have anxiously awaited the news that might
        follow: When the state will start to let up on social distancing. In a
        press briefing on Tuesday afternoon, Governor Gavin Newsom announced
        that California is starting to enter what he dubbed phase four of the
        pandemic, “the optimistic phase,” moving from surge to suppression.
        “This transition, where we do see light at the end of the tunnel, where
        there is a ray of optimism and hopefulness that this too shall pass, is
        also perhaps the most difficult and challenging phase of all,” Newsom
        said during a press conference. “And that’s saying a lot because the
        last few weeks and months have been very challenging for all of us. But
        this phase is one where science, where public health — not politics —
        must be the guide.” Newsom laid out a six-item framework that will guide
        how and when California will modify stay-at-home orders going forward.
        It includes questions about testing and hospital capacities that he says
        must be answered before the state moves from a population approach to an
        individual approach of virus suppression.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Expand testing to trace and track individual outbreaks and ensure the
          isolation and quarantine of those affected.
        </li>
        <li>
          Protect vulnerable populations from infection and spread, most notably
          seniors, people who are immunocompromised, and unhoused individuals.
        </li>
        <li>
          The ability of hospital and healthcare systems to meet the need of
          anticipated surges as stay at home orders are loosened.
        </li>
        <li>
          Work with academia and the pharmaceutical industry as they develop
          treatments and a vaccine for the virus, as well as protocols to
          distribute them.
        </li>
        <li>
          Develop strategies for schools and businesses to adhere to safe
          physical distancing guidelines.
        </li>
        <li>
          A plan to toggle back and forth between stricter and looser social
          distancing requirements depending on how the situation changes.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Newsom applauded Californians for bending the curve with their behavior,
        but he also cautioned that the state is not out of the woods yet. There
        were a record 71 Covid-19-related deaths in California today.
